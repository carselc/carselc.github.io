bee = "Flowers are an object to manifest one’s sympathy, one’s love, one’s grief for another person.  I was to use objects to manifest what cannot be said in words - my love, my grief.  I want to learn how words can do the same, and where they stop being able to do the same.  Words cannot describe the loss you feel. I already know, despite writing what I am writing, that writing cannot contain the depths of your grief. Words are a presence, but your pain is an absence. It is an absence that is impossible to to fill. It is a loss, and a fear. You understand its partial selfishness, but it hurts and it hurts all the same.  I wonder if my Great Aunt Fay, who ___, would say I’ve lost my Yiddishkeite. I wonder if she’d care.  We’ve paid a price. We’ve exchanged our history, our culture, our selves, for safety. We are survivors. But how long can you survive in this way? We value life above all. Has the cost been too great?  That's cold, Dad. That's stone cold Steve Austin, ya know?

My father died the day he forced my mum into $10 000 debt and fled. My father died the day he left the country permanently and told me he would come back.  My father died on all those days I told him I loved him and he wouldn’t say it back.  My father died the day I heard him wonder how I had gone to fat [a combination of genetics, trauma and the habits he taught me] My father died a little more every day he pretended he had a right to my life.  My father died the day he threatened my mother he would take me away from her.  My father died every day he blamed my mother for poisoning me against him instead of taking responsibility for his own actions.  Summertime Where I’m from Summer means not-cold.

He also said that schizophrenics tended to be very secretive, and don't tell others about hallucinatory voices, especially when they are younger, and that therefore he was not surprised that Kip had not mentioned his voices before his arrest. Regarding the lucid moments Kip had between killing his parents and his rampage at school--Kip reportedly ate a bowl of cereal and talked on the phone to his friends after killing his father, and stopped on his way into the cafeteria to warn a friend off--Sack said that such moments were not inconsistent with emerging schizophrenia. The defense also presented evidence of a history of mental illness in Kip's family. Joyce Naffziger, a private investigator, testified about her discovery of multiple cases of mental illness in Kip's extended family, including schizophrenia. Dr. Richard J. Konkol, pediatric neurologist,also testified for the defense. He showed an image of a computerized scan of Kip's brain which he said showed holes in areas of the brain. These images revealed reduced blood flow to the frontal lobe, the area associated with emotional control and decision making. He testified that this reduced brain activity was consistent with new research on children who become schizophrenic, and that he thought it could make Kip more susceptible to a psychotic episode. He added that he thought Kip might improve under proper medication and treatment. It was during Konkol's testimony that Kip lifted his head and watched the proceedings. He had laid his face down on the table or hidden it with his arms for most of the preceding testimony. THE VICTIMS' STATEMENTS After the defense presented its evidence, Judge Mattison heard five hours of statements from 50 victims and members of their families. Unanimously, they called for Mattison to give Kip the maximum possible sentence, and took the opportunity to address Kip directly with their anger and pain. Some described the physical pain from the injuries Kip inflicted; many more described their emotional scars--children unable to sleep for nightmares, afraid to go to school, and relationships between parents and children horribly strained by the ordeal. Many of the victims attacked Kip, vehemently expressing their wishes that he should suffer as they did. Others made reasoned arguments to Judge Mattison, calling for the maximum sentence to keep their community safe and to send a message to other troubled teenagers who may be prone to violence. Kip raised his head and met the eyes of a number of the victims as they spoke. Some of their statements are excerpted here: Jacob Ryker: I don't care if you're sick, if you're insane, if you're crazy. I don't care. I think prison, a lifetime in prison is too good for you. ... I don't think you should go to prison. I think the victims should get to do to you what you did to them. I think you should have to suffer in the hospital like they did. Mark Walker: If Mr. Kinkel is sitting in prison without possibility of release for the rest of his life, it might -- just might -- keep some other young person from taking a gun to school. That would be the only positive thing that could come from this tragedy. Bettina Lynn: I saw so much that day that haunts me. I remember seeing Jesse in front of me, with blood all over his white shirt. ... I saw Jennifer with blood all over her face and neck, and I assumed that she was already dead. I saw a body behind me on the other side of the table, and I didn't know who it was... . Before his sentence was read to him, Kip read the following statement to the victims: I have spent days trying to figure out what I want to say. I have crumpled up dozens of pieces of paper and disregarded even more ideas. I have thought about what I could say that might make people feel just a little bit better. But I have come to the realization that it really doesn't matter what I say. Because there is nothing I can do to take away any of the pain and destruction I have caused. I absolutely loved my parents and had no reason to kill them. I had no reason to dislike, kill or try to kill anyone at Thurston. I am truly sorry that this has happened. I have gone back in my mind hundreds of times and changed one detail, one small event so this never would have happened. I wish I could. I take full responsibility for my actions. These events have pulled me down into a state of deterioration and self-loathing that I didn't know existed. I am very sorry for everything I have done, and for what I have become. THE JUDGE'S RULING After the victims spoke, Kent Mortimore, for the state, and Mark Sabitt, for the defense, concluded by presenting their sentencing recommendations to Judge Mattison. Mortimore called for the maximum sentence, 220 years, and rebuked the defense for attempting to portray Kip as mentally ill: From a very early age, Kip Kinkel was a very nasty, violent, easy-to-frustrate and easy-to-anger boy. This was his essence long before any so-called mental illness. Sabitt responded, noting that the state had offered no testimony to contradict Sack or Bolstad, and appealed to the Mattison to be lenient, taking into consideration Kip's young age and mental state: In a civilized society, we cannot lock up our mentally ill, neurologically impaired fifteen-year-old offenders and throw away the key without a hope for the future. On November 9, Judge Mattison made his final ruling. He opened his statement by citing a 1996 change to the Oregon State Constitution, which shifted the focus of criminal punishment from the principles of reformation to the protection of society and personal accountability. He said, To me, this was a clear statement that the protection of society in general was to be of more importance than the possible reformation or rehabilitation of any individual defendant, and that ... my focus must be much broader than the possible reformation or rehabilitation of Mr. Kinkel. He acknowledged that experts believed that with long-term and extensive medical and therapeutic treatment, Kip might not pose a danger to society if set free, but that at the same time, there was no guaranteed cure for Kip's condition, and that it was unlikely that it would ever be safe to let him be free without extensive supervision and support services. Mattison also focused on the requirement that the sentence should be sufficient to hold Kip accountable for his actions. Referring to the testimony of Kip's surviving victims and their families, he wrote, It became very apparent yesterday that this sentence needed to account for each of the wounded, who rightly call themselves survivors, and for Mr. Kinkel to know there was a price to be paid for each person hit by his bullets. The final sentence for the 26 attempted murder charges was 1040 months, or 86.67 years. Added to the 25 years for the four murders, Kip was sentenced to almost 112 years. Immediately after the sentence was handed down, Kip was transferred to the MacLaren Youth Correctional Facility, a state juvenile prison. He is housed in the Secure Intensive Treatment Program with other young men imprisoned for violent crimes. He will attend school and take part in intensive therapy specifically developed for young violent offenders. He may remain at MacLaren until he turns 25; the length of his stay will be determined by the staff's assessment of his participation in the program and his suitability for adult prison. Kip is the first juvenile to serve a life sentence in the state of Oregon.  APPEAL On December 8, 1999, the Public Defender for the state of Oregon filed a notice of appeal of Kip's sentence. Jesse Barton, deputy public defender, said the primary basis for appeal would be that Kip's sentence amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, defined in the Oregon State Constitution as one which shocks the moral sense of all reasonable persons. He will also likely argue that the sentence violates Oregon's sentencing guidelines. Other possible avenues include the argument that Kip was denied due process because he was not granted a hearing to determine if he should be tried in juvenile court, and that Judge Mattison erred in his interpretation of the factors he was required to weigh under the new constitutional language. The appeal process is expected to be lengthy and contentious. A decision from the appellate court is not likely until at least the spring of 2001, and after that, it is probable that one side will appeal to the state Supreme Court. If the appeals fail, the only chance Kip has for a life out of prison will be a commutation of his sentence by the governor, if he can prove that he is rehabilitated, has atoned for his crime and no longer poses a threat to society. Such commutations are extremely rare, especially in cases involving mental illness. "
