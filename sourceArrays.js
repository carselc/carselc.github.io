bee = "Lethal Fantasies of a 15-Year-Old Became a Reality A week before this small city of lumber yards and computer chips was changed forever on Thursday morning, Bill Kinkel, a widely respected retired high school Spanish teacher, made a tennis date with an old friend over the telephone. Before hanging up, the friend, Tom Jacobson, asked Mr. Kinkel about his son Kipland, a skinny 15-year-old freshman at Thurston High School here whom everyone calls Kip. Mr. Kinkel, 59, and his wife, Faith, 57, who also taught Spanish, had been worried about their son's temper since he was a little boy. Their heartache only grew when they discovered a stash of bomb-making books in his bedroom four years ago. About a year and a half ago, they sent him to a psychiatrist and pulled him out of school for a time and taught him at home, hoping he would find his way. But in recent months, it looked as though their worry and work were finally paying off. The boy was back in school and 'Bill said he saw the light at the end of the tunnel,' Mr. Jacobson said in an interview. 'I asked him how Kip was doing and he said, 'Well, he's never going to be perfect.' But he really thought things were turning around. Kip's grades were a little better. He was doing better at school.' The old friends were scheduled to play tennis on Thursday morning, about the same time the police say Kip walked into the Thurston High cafeteria, pulled a semiautomatic rifle from beneath his trench coat, jumped on top of a table and sprayed the room with 51 .22-caliber bullets, killing two students and wounding 22 others. But the killing did not begin in the cafeteria. Before leaving for school that morning, armed with two pistols and the rifle, Kip also shot his parents to death, investigators said. Five homemade bombs were later found in the house. Now, this town will begin burying its dead, but it may never know exactly why. There are plenty of clues and no solid answers. The day before the shooting, Kip had been suspended from Thurston when a stolen handgun he bought from a classmate was found in his school locker. Revenge is one possible motive some in this shell-shocked community seem to halfheartedly cling to. But it seems too empty an explanation. Students get suspended and expelled all the time and they do not come back with a rifle. In more than two dozen interviews with coaches, family members, neighbors and classmates, the picture of Kipland P. Kinkel that is emerging is split in two: the polite youngster with good manners drilled into him by his parents who behaved impeccably around adults, and the tough-talking, joke-cracking mischief-maker who showed himself at school. Kip, Mr. Jacobson said, 'had two different personalities.' He was a skinny youth with some interests not unlike any other 15-year-old. He loved karate and played middle linebacker for the freshman football team, the Thurston Colts, although he did not see much action. But friends say that he was a bright boy who struggled with his grades, that he built tree houses for his young neighbors but that he also tortured small animals. He had a great sense of humor, and a terrible temper. He got bullied, and did his share of bullying. But he made no secret of his troubled soul and angry heart. He told a couple of school bus mates recently that he idolized the Unabomber and 'the guys who did the Oklahoma City bombing.' 'He always said it would be funny if someone blew up the school and went on a rampage,' said Dale R. Coon, 16, a sophomore at Thurston, who often rode the bus with Kip. He also boasted about putting lighted firecrackers into the mouths of squirrels and chipmunks, and he had a good laugh recounting to some of his friends how he tricked his mother into buying a batch of chemicals that he told her were for a school science project. Instead, he told his buddies with a big grin on his face, he used the chemicals to make bombs. 'He talked about blowing people up for as long as I can remember,' said Lorraine Richardson, a neighbor, whose daughter took tennis lessons from Kip's father. Kip also talked about guns like some teen-age boys talk about girls. When one friend, Mike Joseph, asked him why he loved guns so much, Kip replied, 'because when I snap, I want to have all the firepower I can, so I can kill as many people as I can.' But he did not just tell friends in private that his mind was full of violence. One day in a literature class, when it was his turn to read his dreams from his journal, Kip stood up and told the class that he wanted to kill. But school officials said such talk was not unusual among students, and was often dismissed as just blowing off steam. 'His teachers still viewed him as a good student,' the Springfield superintendent of schools, Jamon Kent, said at a news conference on Friday. 'He was a typical 15-year-old.' Paul Mones, an expert on children who kill, said that although many teen-agers and adults might have said in frustration that they wanted to kill someone, Kip's constant drumbeat about murder and mayhem was a clear signal that he was not 'an average 15-year-old.' His preoccupation with violence and reported abuse of animals, Mr. Mones said, were classic signs that he was headed for deadly trouble, like other teen-agers who have exploded in violence. 'These kids typically live on the homicide-suicide axis,' said Mr. Mones, a lawyer and author of 'When Children Kill' (Simon & Schuster, 1991). 'They could just as easily kill themselves as anyone else. Most of these kids live in such inner turmoil, that they have no idea what's really going on around them.' Mr. Mones said that before these youths snap they rarely stand out to authorities. Before Thursday morning, Kip's only run-in with the law was an arrest for throwing rocks from an overpass at cars. It is unclear whether the attack on the cafeteria was planned. A classmate said that the day before the shooting, Kip 'talked about killing everybody he could.' Another classmate said that Kip had warned a couple of his friends not to go into the cafeteria. But hardly anyone ever took Kip's violent talk seriously. 'He talked about bombs,' said Mandy Axtel, 15, who rode the school bus with him. 'I thought, 'big deal.' Guys are always making up stories to impress their friends.' Dave Wing has known Kip for most of the boy's life. Mr. Wing coached him in sports for years, beginning in a T-ball league when he was 5 or 6 years old. He also coached Kip in grade school baseball, soccer and basketball. 'He was good,' Mr. Wing said. 'He could steal the ball in a heartbeat. He was quick.' The boy he knew had a hot temper that would flare up in a second, but 'you could always settle him down' with a few words and a pat on the back. Kip seemed to use his temper to compensate for his lack of size. He was smaller than most of the other youths. But he never backed down from a confrontation and was often the aggressor, pushing and shoving. 'Basically,' Mr. Wing said, 'he was a decent, normal kid.' But around the time Kip began middle school, Mr. Wing said, he started to change, hanging out with a rougher crowd. He also started talking about bombs all the time and a lot of his old friends, like Mr. Wing's son, began to keep their distance. Mr. Wing, who owns a market and filling station on the road that leads to the Kinkel home outside of town, said that Kip"

casey = "me, and I stand fooled. He also said that schizophrenics tended to be very secretive, and don't tell others about hallucinatory voices, especially when they are younger, and that therefore he was not surprised that Kip had not mentioned his voices before his arrest. Regarding the lucid moments Kip had between killing his parents and his rampage at school--Kip reportedly ate a bowl of cereal and talked on the phone to his friends after killing his father, and stopped on his way into the cafeteria to warn a friend off--Sack said that such moments were not inconsistent with emerging schizophrenia. The defense also presented evidence of a history of mental illness in Kip's family. Joyce Naffziger, a private investigator, testified about her discovery of multiple cases of mental illness in Kip's extended family, including schizophrenia. Dr. Richard J. Konkol, pediatric neurologist,also testified for the defense. He showed an image of a computerized scan of Kip's brain which he said showed holes in areas of the brain. These images revealed reduced blood flow to the frontal lobe, the area associated with emotional control and decision making. He testified that this reduced brain activity was consistent with new research on children who become schizophrenic, and that he thought it could make Kip more susceptible to a psychotic episode. He added that he thought Kip might improve under proper medication and treatment. It was during Konkol's testimony that Kip lifted his head and watched the proceedings. He had laid his face down on the table or hidden it with his arms for most of the preceding testimony. THE VICTIMS' STATEMENTS After the defense presented its evidence, Judge Mattison heard five hours of statements from 50 victims and members of their families. Unanimously, they called for Mattison to give Kip the maximum possible sentence, and took the opportunity to address Kip directly with their anger and pain. Some described the physical pain from the injuries Kip inflicted; many more described their emotional scars--children unable to sleep for nightmares, afraid to go to school, and relationships between parents and children horribly strained by the ordeal. Many of the victims attacked Kip, vehemently expressing their wishes that he should suffer as they did. Others made reasoned arguments to Judge Mattison, calling for the maximum sentence to keep their community safe and to send a message to other troubled teenagers who may be prone to violence. Kip raised his head and met the eyes of a number of the victims as they spoke. Some of their statements are excerpted here: Jacob Ryker: I don't care if you're sick, if you're insane, if you're crazy. I don't care. I think prison, a lifetime in prison is too good for you. ... I don't think you should go to prison. I think the victims should get to do to you what you did to them. I think you should have to suffer in the hospital like they did. Mark Walker: If Mr. Kinkel is sitting in prison without possibility of release for the rest of his life, it might -- just might -- keep some other young person from taking a gun to school. That would be the only positive thing that could come from this tragedy. Bettina Lynn: I saw so much that day that haunts me. I remember seeing Jesse in front of me, with blood all over his white shirt. ... I saw Jennifer with blood all over her face and neck, and I assumed that she was already dead. I saw a body behind me on the other side of the table, and I didn't know who it was... . Before his sentence was read to him, Kip read the following statement to the victims: I have spent days trying to figure out what I want to say. I have crumpled up dozens of pieces of paper and disregarded even more ideas. I have thought about what I could say that might make people feel just a little bit better. But I have come to the realization that it really doesn't matter what I say. Because there is nothing I can do to take away any of the pain and destruction I have caused. I absolutely loved my parents and had no reason to kill them. I had no reason to dislike, kill or try to kill anyone at Thurston. I am truly sorry that this has happened. I have gone back in my mind hundreds of times and changed one detail, one small event so this never would have happened. I wish I could. I take full responsibility for my actions. These events have pulled me down into a state of deterioration and self-loathing that I didn't know existed. I am very sorry for everything I have done, and for what I have become. THE JUDGE'S RULING After the victims spoke, Kent Mortimore, for the state, and Mark Sabitt, for the defense, concluded by presenting their sentencing recommendations to Judge Mattison. Mortimore called for the maximum sentence, 220 years, and rebuked the defense for attempting to portray Kip as mentally ill: From a very early age, Kip Kinkel was a very nasty, violent, easy-to-frustrate and easy-to-anger boy. This was his essence long before any so-called mental illness. Sabitt responded, noting that the state had offered no testimony to contradict Sack or Bolstad, and appealed to the Mattison to be lenient, taking into consideration Kip's young age and mental state: In a civilized society, we cannot lock up our mentally ill, neurologically impaired fifteen-year-old offenders and throw away the key without a hope for the future. On November 9, Judge Mattison made his final ruling. He opened his statement by citing a 1996 change to the Oregon State Constitution, which shifted the focus of criminal punishment from the principles of reformation to the protection of society and personal accountability. He said, To me, this was a clear statement that the protection of society in general was to be of more importance than the possible reformation or rehabilitation of any individual defendant, and that ... my focus must be much broader than the possible reformation or rehabilitation of Mr. Kinkel. He acknowledged that experts believed that with long-term and extensive medical and therapeutic treatment, Kip might not pose a danger to society if set free, but that at the same time, there was no guaranteed cure for Kip's condition, and that it was unlikely that it would ever be safe to let him be free without extensive supervision and support services. Mattison also focused on the requirement that the sentence should be sufficient to hold Kip accountable for his actions. Referring to the testimony of Kip's surviving victims and their families, he wrote, It became very apparent yesterday that this sentence needed to account for each of the wounded, who rightly call themselves survivors, and for Mr. Kinkel to know there was a price to be paid for each person hit by his bullets. The final sentence for the 26 attempted murder charges was 1040 months, or 86.67 years. Added to the 25 years for the four murders, Kip was sentenced to almost 112 years. Immediately after the sentence was handed down, Kip was transferred to the MacLaren Youth Correctional Facility, a state juvenile prison. He is housed in the Secure Intensive Treatment Program with other young men imprisoned for violent crimes. He will attend school and take part in intensive therapy specifically developed for young violent offenders. He may remain at MacLaren until he turns 25; the length of his stay will be determined by the staff's assessment of his participation in the program and his suitability for adult prison. Kip is the first juvenile to serve a life sentence in the state of Oregon.  APPEAL On December 8, 1999, the Public Defender for the state of Oregon filed a notice of appeal of Kip's sentence. Jesse Barton, deputy public defender, said the primary basis for appeal would be that Kip's sentence amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, defined in the Oregon State Constitution as one which shocks the moral sense of all reasonable persons. He will also likely argue that the sentence violates Oregon's sentencing guidelines. Other possible avenues include the argument that Kip was denied due process because he was not granted a hearing to determine if he should be tried in juvenile court, and that Judge Mattison erred in his interpretation of the factors he was required to weigh under the new constitutional language. The appeal process is expected to be lengthy and contentious. A decision from the appellate court is not likely until at least the spring of 2001, and after that, it is probable that one side will appeal to the state Supreme Court. If the appeals fail, the only chance Kip has for a life out of prison will be a commutation of his sentence by the governor, if he can prove that he is rehabilitated, has atoned for his crime and no longer poses a threat to society. Such commutations are extremely rare, especially in cases involving mental illness. "
